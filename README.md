# Project:Don't Hack Me!
***
#### Sth not important
>This is a kind of tool for "encoding" your source(with define) to avoid being hacked in CodeForces contest (whatever. :-)
>>it makes your code hard to understand.


*I have been hacked so many times that my rating decrease sharply and my name turned grey*
###### факты
***
#### How to use(on macOS/Unix/Linux)
0.Install.

1.Run the programm.(like this,whatever)
```bash
dont_hack_me
```
2.Input the source file path
```bash
/User/admin/hentai/233.cpp
```
3.Input the target file path.
```bash
/User/admin/hentai/234.cpp
```
4.Check and fix. You may need to move header part to the top and fix a few compile errors.
***
#### How to use(on Windows)
0.Find main.cpp

1.Download and compile it.

2.Run as the above steps.

#### Sth important
I have to tell you that the more space inputting between the codes, the file more difficult to understand.Just like those two, the first one will be more difficult to understand, though they're same. But don't put too many spaces, your code may be not able to compile...(I really don't know how to fix it...)
```cpp
for ( int i = 1; i <= n; i ++ )
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
```
_REALLY IMPORTANT POINTS !!!!_
> - You need to delete the header part from your source before you try to encode it.(Cuz #define can't change header)
- Don't use space to devide the macro function!
- If you have any other questions, ask them in issue part or send emails to me.( AndrewWayne2016@gmail.com )
## If it works well pls star the project!
# I believe you'll become a legendary grandmaster!
