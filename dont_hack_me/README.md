#### Sth important
I have to tell you that the more space inputting between the codes, the file more difficult to understand.Just like those two, the first one will be more difficult to understand, though they're same.
```cpp
for ( int i = 1; i <= n; i ++ )
for(int i=1;i<=n;i++)
```
## If it works well pls star the project!
